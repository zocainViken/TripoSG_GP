TripoSG is an advanced high-fidelity, high-quality and high-generalizability image-to-3D generation foundation model. It leverages large-scale rectified flow transformers, hybrid supervised training, and a high-quality dataset to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **High-Fidelity Generation**: Produces meshes with sharp geometric features, fine surface details, and complex structures
- **Semantic Consistency**: Generated shapes accurately reflect input image semantics and appearance
- **Strong Generalization**: Handles diverse input styles including photorealistic images, cartoons, and sketches
- **Robust Performance**: Creates coherent shapes even for challenging inputs with complex topology

## üî¨ Technical Highlights

- **Large-Scale Rectified Flow Transformer**: Combines RF's linear trajectory modeling with transformer architecture for stable, efficient training
- **Advanced VAE Architecture**: Uses Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with hybrid supervision combining SDF loss, surface normal guidance, and eikonal loss
- **High-Quality Dataset**: Trained on 2 million meticulously curated Image-SDF pairs, ensuring superior output quality
- **Efficient Scaling**: Implements architecture optimizations for high performance even at smaller model scales

## üî• Updates

* [2025-04] Release TripoSG-scribble, a CFG-distilled, 512 token model for fast shape prototyping from scribble+prompt! Try the online demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/VAST-AI/TripoSG-scribble).
* [2025-03] Release of TripoSG 1.5B parameter rectified flow model and VAE trained on 2048 latent tokens, along with inference code and interactive demo

## üî® Installation

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TripoSG.git
cd TripoSG
```

Create a conda environment (optional):
```bash
conda create -n tripoSG python=3.10
conda activate tripoSG
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
# pytorch (select correct CUDA version)
# pytorch < 2.9.0
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/{your-cuda-version}

# other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üí° Quick Start

Generate a 3D mesh from an image:
```bash
python -m scripts.inference_triposg_mmgp --image-input assets/example_data/hjswed.png --output-path ./output.glb
```

Limiting the number of faces:
```bash
python -m scripts.inference_triposg_mmgp --image-input assets/example_data/hjswed.png --faces 5000 --output-path ./output.glb
```

Gradio app:
```bash
python gradio_inference_mmgp_fr.py
python gradio_inference_mmgp.py
```

or from scribble+prompt: *** NOT TESTED ***
```bash
 python -m scripts.inference_triposg_scribble --image-input assets/example_scribble_data/cat_with_wings.png --prompt "a cat with wings" --scribble-conf 0.3 --output-path output.glb
```

The required model weights will be automatically downloaded:
- TripoSG (image condition) model from [VAST-AI/TripoSG](https://huggingface.co/VAST-AI/TripoSG) ‚Üí `pretrained_weights/TripoSG`
= TripoSG-scribble (scribble+prompt condition) model from [VAST-AI/TripoSG-scribble](https://huggingface.co/VAST-AI/TripoSG-scribble) ‚Üí `pretrained_weights/TripoSG-scribble`
- RMBG model from [briaai/RMBG-1.4](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4) ‚Üí `pretrained_weights/RMBG-1.4`

## üíª System Requirements

- CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 6GB VRAM for 3D model generation and 14GB of RAM
- CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 8GB VRAM for texturing model generation and 32GB of RAM

## üìù Tips
*** NOT TESTED ***
- If you want to use the full VAE module (including the encoder part), you need to uncomment the Line-15 in `triposg/models/autoencoders/autoencoder_kl_triposg.py` and install `torch-cluster`. and run:
```
python -m scripts.inference_vae --surface-input assets/example_data_point/surface_point_demo.npy
```
